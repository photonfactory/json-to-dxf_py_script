JSON output to DXF file converter V1.0
======================================


## Program features

Takes json output which contains information regarding drawing entities e.g. lines, circles, rectangles and draws those entities into an R12 dxf file.

The json data should be contained within a text file. The python script should be run with the json text file as an argument.

## Notes

For this script to work you need to include the template.dxf in the directory in which the python script is to be run.
The template.dxf file sets the dxf file type to R12 and the dimensions to mm.
